# Lightbikes

The second game in the series, "Trying to build a usable game framework" and 
finally start making games.

The main goals of this game are:
- Build a basic asset pipeline/management system
- Implement a basic rendering system (probably using sdl built ins)
- Implement a basic ui system
- Implement a basic networking system
    - I'd like this to be a rollback system like GGPO
    - Only basic peer-to-peer connections for now
- Finish it up with better profiling tools
