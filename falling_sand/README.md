# Falling Sand

Falling sand is my interpretation of classic falling sand games.
It is the first "game" I made in this repo.

It's main purpose was mostly for me to get some familiarity with SDL and 
start getting utilities I'd need for other games implemented in yage.

These included:
- Basic game loop
- Basic game state
- Basic game systems
- Game resources


As I retroactively added the yage features into falling_sand there is definitely
some weirdness that I may come back and clean up later.
